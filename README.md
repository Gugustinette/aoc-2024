[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event where you solve coding puzzles. This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 edition.

It is also part of the [Deno Advent of Code Challenge](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024) where you can win a Deno stickers by solving the puzzles with Deno.

## Running the code
To run the code, you'll need [Deno](https://deno.land/).
For example, to run the code for day 1 :
```
deno run day-1
```
